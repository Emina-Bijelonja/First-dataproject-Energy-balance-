# First-dataproject-Energy-balance-
Brief analysis of electrical energy produced in a solar power plant and consumed in a client building
This project started off with two csv files that contained 15-minute electrical power measures for entire year (around 35040 rows in both files). 
First file is from a solar power plant and it shows the production of a 10kW plant during 1 year.
Second file has the data from a "client" building and the utilized electrical power for every 15 minutes again during a year.
The data were not cleaned and ready for use, so first part of the project was data cleaning.
After that, client can chose the size of the power plant that he could install (ex. 55kW) to see if his consumption needs will be met.
